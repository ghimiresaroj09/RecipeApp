                    <p>
                        I am Saroj Ghimire, a young and ambitious student currently pursuing a degree in IT at Texas College of Management and IT (TCMIT). I was born and raised in Nepal, where I developed a passion for technology and a curiosity for how things work. As a child, I was always fascinated by computers and spent countless hours tinkering with them to better understand their inner workings.
                        <br>
                        After completing my secondary education, I enrolled in Jaya Multiple Campus (JMC), where I studied computer science and mathematics. At JMC, I was a dedicated student who consistently earned high grades and gained the respect of my teachers and peers alike. I was particularly drawn to programming and software development, and I spent countless hours honing my skills in these areas.
                        <br>
                        In 2019, I made the decision to pursue my passion for technology by enrolling in the IT program at TCMIT. From the moment I set foot on campus, I knew that I had made the right decision. I was impressed by the faculty, the facilities, and the overall atmosphere of the college. I dove headfirst into my studies, eager to learn and grow as a professional.
                        <br>
                        Over the past few years, I have worked tirelessly to improve my technical skills and deepen my understanding of the IT industry. I have taken on challenging projects and collaborated with my peers to develop innovative solutions to complex problems. I have also participated in various extracurricular activities, such as programming competitions and hackathons, to further hone my skills.

                        Outside of my academic pursuits, I am a responsible and disciplined individual who takes my commitments seriously. I am a voracious reader who enjoys staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends and industry developments. I am also an avid football fan and enjoy playing the game in my free time.
                        <br>
                        Looking ahead, I am excited about the many opportunities that the IT industry has to offer. I am committed to using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on society, and I am eager to continue learning and growing as a professional. With my natural curiosity, strong work ethic, and passion for technology, I am confident that I will achieve great success in my future endeavors.
